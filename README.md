### Hello Fellow Strangers

I am a Software Developer and GNU/Linux Geek 🐧

Local Software > Cloud || free software > Proprietary software/bloatware

### I want to keep my software as minimalistic as possible, that is why i use:
-gnu nano
-Neovim(i will provide some configs later on)
-WM instead DE
-GNU ICECAT instead of Chromium based Bloat
-my custom version of debian
-Go instead of JS/TS if possible(i am not a web dev; neither fronted or backend)
### My main languages are:
